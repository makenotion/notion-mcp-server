### Installation

#### 1. Setting up Integration in Notion:
Go to [https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations](https://www.notion.so/profile/integrations) and create a new **internal** integration or select an existing one.

#### 2. Adding MCP config to your client:

 Add the following to your `.cursor/mcp.json` or `claude_desktop_config.json` (MacOS: `~/Library/Application\ Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`)

```javascript
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "notionApi": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@notionhq/notion-mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "OPENAPI_MCP_HEADERS": "{\"Authorization\": \"Bearer ntn_****\", \"Notion-Version\": \"2022-06-28\" }"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Don't forget to replace `ntn_****` with your integration secret. Find it from your integration configuration tab:

#### 3. Connecting content to integration:
Ensure relevant pages and databases are connected to your integration.

To do this, you'll need to visit that page, and click on the 3 dots, and select "Connect to integration".

### Examples

1. Using the following instruction
```
Comment "Hello MCP" on page "Getting started"
```

AI will correctly plan two API calls, `v1/search` and `v1/comments`, to achieve the task

2. Similarly, the following instruction will result in a new page named "Notion MCP" added to parent page "Development"
```
Add a page titled "Notion MCP" to page "Development"
```

3. You may also reference content ID directly
```
Get the content of page 1a6b35e6e67f802fa7e1d27686f017f2
```
